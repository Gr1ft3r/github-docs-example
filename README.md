# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with single quotation (')

### Backtick location on keyboard

- Make note of where the backtick button is located.
- It should appear above the tab key, but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Input a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the input is non-negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
else:
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
```

- When you can you should attempt to apply snytax highlighting to your codeblocks

```Python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Input a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the input is non-negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
else:
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
```

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Errors that appear in the console.

```Python
# This code contains a deliberate NameError
def print_message():
    print(unknown_variable)

# Call the function
print_message()
```

> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in Python.

## Step 2 - How to take screenshots

A screenshot is when you capture a part of you screen from your laptop desktop or phone.

This is not to be confused with taking a photo with your phone.

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavoured Markdown Task Lists

Github extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#external-references)

- [x] Finish Step 1
- [ ] Finish Step 2
- [x] Finish Step 3

## Step 4 - User Emojis (Optional)

Github Flavoured Markdown supports emoji shortcodes.

Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speak No Evil | `:speak_no_evil:` | ðŸ™Š

## Step 5 How to create a table

You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speak No Evil | `:speak_no_evil:` | ðŸ™Š
```

### Location of the Pipe character on a keyboard

- It may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more alignment and table cell formatting options. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#external-references)
